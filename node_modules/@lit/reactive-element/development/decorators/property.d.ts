/**
 * A property decorator which creates a reactive property that reflects a
 * corresponding attribute value. When a decorated property is set
 * the element will update and render. A [[`PropertyDeclaration`]] may
 * optionally be supplied to configure property features.
 *
 * This decorator should only be used for public fields. As public fields,
 * properties should be considered as primarily settable by element users,
 * either via attribute or the property itself.
 *
 * Generally, properties that are changed by the element should be private or
 * protected fields and should use the [[`state`]] decorator.
 *
 * However, sometimes element code does need to set a public property. This
 * should typically only be done in response to user interaction, and an event
 * should be fired informing the user; for example, a checkbox sets its
 * `checked` property when clicked and fires a `changed` event. Mutating public
 * properties should typically not be done for non-primitive (object or array)
 * properties. In other cases when an element needs to manage state, a private
 * property decorated via the [[`state`]] decorator should be used. When needed,
 * state properties can be initialized via public properties to facilitate
 * complex interactions.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * class MyElement {
 *   @property({ type: Boolean })
 *   clicked = false;
 * }
 * ```
