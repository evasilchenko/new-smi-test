/**
 * LitElement patch to support browsers without native web components.
 *
 * This module should be used in addition to loading the web components
 * polyfills via @webcomponents/webcomponentjs. When using those polyfills
 * support for polyfilled Shadow DOM is automatic via the ShadyDOM polyfill, but
 * support for Shadow DOM like css scoping is opt-in. This module uses ShadyCSS
 * to scope styles defined via the `static styles` property and styles included
 * in the render method. There are some limitations to be aware of:
 * * only styles that are included in the first render of a component are scoped.
 * * In addition, support for the deprecated `@apply` feature of ShadyCSS is
 * only provided for styles included in the template and not styles provided
 * via the static styles property.
 * * Lit parts cannot be used in styles included in the template.
