 * We currently do not make a mangled rollup build of the lit-ssr code. In order
 * to keep a number of (otherwise private) top-level exports  mangled in the
 * client side code, we export a _$private object containing those members (or
 * helper methods for accessing private fields of those members), and then
 * re-export them for use in lit-ssr. This keeps lit-ssr agnostic to whether the
 * client-side code is being used in `dev` mode or `prod` mode.
